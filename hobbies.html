    <p>I don't have a lot of free time, but when I have it I like to spend it doing the things I love and with my dear ones.</p>
    <p>These are some the things I like to do when I have some free time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I love to dance. Dancing is like a form of art and I like to get rid of negative energy by dancing.</li>
      <li>Coding is my newfound love. And it's great for my career too.</li>
      <li>Watching TV shows is definetly my guilty pleasure! P.S. Doug Heffernan is my favourite.</li>
    </ul>
